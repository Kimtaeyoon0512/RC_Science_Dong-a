# 과학동아 RC카


This is Gyro-controlling, RC car project!


There's 4 modes,

1. Gyro controlling mode (with uniform velocity)

2. On mode 1, accelerating with flex sensor.

3. On mode 2, accelerating with sound sensor.

4. On mode 1, left, right turn goes 180 degree.




PARTS
=====================================

1. MPU6050 x 1
2. HC06 x 2 (master, slave.)
        -> HC06 or other module, no matter with using, but have to edit source code a bit.
3. L298n x 1
4. DC motor x 2
5. Arduino uno x 1
6. Arduino nano x 1
        -> other boards are okay, but maybe you have to re-edit your pin mapping.
